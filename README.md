# Project Summary:
The aim of this project is to develop a mobile application that takes scanned gujarati handwritten image as input and extracts characters (alphabets, digits, symbols) from it. The
image can be of a handwritten gujarati document or printed document. The application will recognize the text from the image and convert it into the readable text. Along with this, our application will keep a history of scanned records.

# Purpose:
We have found that some people find difficulty in reading gujarati handwritten documents and cannot able to recognize what is written. So, our main purpose is to recognize the gujarati handwritten text and convert it to readable text.

# Objective:
1. Collect gujarati handwritten dataset
2. To decide the machine learning model according to the dataset and then train it
3. Testing of the model
4. Create mobile application
5. Integrate model with mobile application

# Scope:
This mobile application can be used by anyone to recognize handwritten gujarati text and convert it to a readable format. The mobile application might recognize text with an accuracy up to 90%. The mobile application depends on the scanning quality of camera, if quality is good then it can able to recognize the text easily and with greater accuracy.
